Hi! I'm Devin and I made this with my partner Alethria. I am going into my second year Majoring in Information Systems at Pace University.

This program is a classifier. It trains on images found from datasets in Kaggle.

Authors of the data sets we used are

The classifier takes images from one of four pokemon and trains a neural network to be able to differentiate between the four. Then takes alittle over 60 images to test and classifies them into one of the four groups.
